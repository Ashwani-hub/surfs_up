# Surfs-Up

## Project Overview
Calculate and Analyze temperature trends, specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

To attain the objectives two separate queries were ran for the months of June and December. Once the queries were generated, temperatures were stored in list and converted to a dataframe. Summary Statistics was obtained using .describe method

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite

## Analysis

Average temperature of 74.9°F was recorded in June with temperature ranging from 64° - 85°), while,
Average temperature of 71.0°F was recorded in December with temperature ranging from 56° - 83°) 

  

## Summary

Based on the completed analysis, there is only average temperature difference of approximately 4°F, just based on the temperature study, it should not make much difference to the sales between the two months.

In order to forecast the sustainability of the business year-round, further analysis maybe required. 

Further analysis of the weather pattern, hot spots in the area and humidity should be considered as these will also effect how many patrons may visit the stand.
